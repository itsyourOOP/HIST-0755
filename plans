easiest plan to get a C

- Public reflections
- Cohort discussions
- Unit Review sheets

that's all you need to do; so those will be the ones I focus on

idea - 2 cohort discussions, and 1 public reflection each day



- professor's idea
	- for each day
		1: Week 2 Cohort Discussion
		2: Week 3 Cohort Discussion and Public Reflection
		3: Week 4 Cohort Discussion
		4: Week 5 Cohort Discussion and Public Reflection
		5: Week 6 Cohort Discussion
