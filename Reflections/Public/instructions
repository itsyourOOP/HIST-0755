1) Public Reflections (C-Tier, 5 CPx6)): a post about the reading and/or lecture video from 
the current solo phase on a shared discussion board that everyone in class can see. This 
can be a reflection paragraph of at least 100 words about the reading, but it could also 
be video, audio, an image (even a meme), or anything else you want. If the relevance of 
your post to the current week’s solo phase material is not self-explanatory, offer a brief 
explanation. To successfully complete this assignment, you just need to demonstrate 
that you’ve done the reading and/or watched the lecture video.
